# Tabletop RPG Tools
A compilation of easy-to-use custom functions and tools I've created in R to simulate character creation, economics, immigration, combat, or just to save myself time when playing tabletop RPGs like Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

These are still very much works in progress, but please feel free to fork, modify, and use these as you please. I hope to assemble them into a convenient package in the future.
